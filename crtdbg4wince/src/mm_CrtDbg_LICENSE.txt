Preamble
========
This Non-Exclusive Software License Agreement (the "Agreement") is made between you (if you are an individual who will 
make personal use of the Software) or your organization (if you are acting on behalf of an organization who will use the 
Software) (in either case, "You" or "Your") and the person known as Modem-Man@gmx.net (the "Licensor" or 
"Copyright Holder"). The effective date of this Agreement is when You install the accompanying files to Your computer.
For good and valuable consideration (the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged), We agree as follows:

"You" and "your" means any person who would like to use, copy, distribute, or modify the package.

their license completely separately from the Agreement you're reading now.

Details:
=======
This License establishes the Terms under which the given Software Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or 
redistributed. The major intent is that the Copyright Holder gets some tiny share of the commercial benefit You earned by using 
this Software Package. Sharing a small amount of your financial (or time==money) benefit with a person who spent his spare 
time to make you earning the benefit, must be considered fair.

More intentions are:
A) You are welcome to use this software package, it's cheap and it is worth it's money.
B) Another intention is to spread this package widely, while continuously improving it (see distribution).
C) One more intention is to encourage all non-commercial and/or non-profit user to use and recommend this package.
    Just do it, it is free for you!

(1) Any use, modification, and distribution of the standard or modified versions is governed by this license. 
By using, modifying or distributing the package, you accept this license. 
Do not use, modify, or distribute the package, if you do not accept this license.

(2) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, 
you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.

Permissions for (Re)distribution
================================
(1) You may Distribute verbatim copies of this package in any medium (either gratis nor for a distribution Fee) if,
    and only if you keep this licence agreement with the package and point to the need to accept this agreement.

(2) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications and make it available back to the 
    copyright holder. You are encouraged, but not required to do such.

(3) You may NOT distribute your modified version as source (neither gratis nor for a fee) in another way than

General Provisions
==================
(1) Disclaimer of Warranty: 
THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. 
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE 
EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. 

UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. 
IN CASE, SUCH LIABILITY IS REQUIRED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW, THIS LICENSE TERMINATES AND YOU NEED TO STOP USING THIS PRODUCT 
IMMEDIATELY.

How much is it?
===============
This depends on You and your conscience. It's a good rule of thumb to donate 50 EURO per User, or to donate 10 percent 
of the money you saved by using this software package (compared to buying another software package or compared to 
improving or debugging or testing your product without using this software package). Saved time should be calculated 
into an appropriate amount of saved money. If you consider this too low, just raise it a bit. 

Please keep always in mind: You can enforce further development and support, by enforcing donations / fees. 
The license holder can spend his time on home improvement and yard work - or he can hire a service 
provider for doing such, while spending his time to the software package. It depends on you.



Donation or Fee?
================
As you like it. It's your decision. If you're using the SourceForge.net donation system, please read the SourceForge.net pages.
